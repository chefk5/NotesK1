An android app I did for may android course. Where you can add, update and sgare quotes on Facebook and more!

What does this app do?

1.A quotes list written in JSON is parsed into a list.

2.User choses a quote, he can:

  a.edit the quote.
  
  b.Share it in Facebook (Using FB SDK).
  
  c.Make a Google search based on the quote.
  
  d.Save the quote on his phone (SQLite)
  
After saving the quote the user can:

  a.Update,Delete & create new quote.
  
  b.Add the quote to an image (black background only).
  
3. The user can rate authors he like. His Ratings are saved online.

There is a rock, paper & scissor game included.
