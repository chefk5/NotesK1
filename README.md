An android app I did for may android course. Where you can add, update and sgare quotes on Facebook and more!

What does this app do?

<b>1.A quotes list written in JSON is parsed into a list.</b>

<b>2.The user can rate authors he like. His Ratings are saved online.</b>

<b>3.User choses a quote, he can:</b>

  a.edit the quote.
  
  b.Share it in Facebook (Using FB SDK).
  
  c.Make a Google search based on the quote.
  
  d.Save the quote on his phone (SQLite)
  
<b>After saving the quote the user can:</b>

  a.Update,Delete and create new quote.
  
  b.Add the quote to an image (black background only).
  


There is a rock, paper and scissor game included.
